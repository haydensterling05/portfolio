#### Project 1: Species Classification Model
This project was completed during my time working at TaroAI as a Data Science Intern. 

My goal for this project was to develop a machine learning model in Python to successfully predict the species of a tree based on an image. I used various approaches to solve this computer vision problem and worked across different datasets provided to me by the company. After trying many different approaches to the model, I achieved ~85% accuracy in the most successful approach. 

Skills used:
- Data cleaning
- Model training/testing
- Model evaluation
- Multi-class classification
- Large language models
- Various APIs

#### Project 2: Survey Data Analysis
I completed this project as a final exam for one of my DS classes at Northwestern. 

I worked with a large dataset of over 1000 students and extracted useful insights relating to student social behavior. Using various statistical methods and analysesl I validated my results and created visualizations to display my work. I worked with two other peers and collaborated using R.
