## Data Science Portfolio

#### Project 1: Species Classification Model
This project was completed during my time at an internship. 

#### Project 2: Survey Data Analysis
I completed this project as a final for one of my DS classes at Northwestern. I worked with a large dataset of over 1000 students and extracted useful insights relating to student social behavior. I worked with two other peers.
